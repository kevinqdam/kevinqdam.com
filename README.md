# My personal website
I took much inspiration from [Lee Rob's personal website](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) but switched over to Astro from Next.js since I only intend to deploy and publish static content at this time.

## Technology stack

### [Astro](https://astro.build/)
I use Astro as my framework for file-based routing and static site generation. It also uses Vite for the development server and bundling for the production build of the website.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
For some components, I use React with the plugin from Astro. This is helpful for the few interactive components I have, and it is the framework/library I am most used to for building user interfaces.

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
I style my pages and components with Tailwind CSS with the respective Astro plugin.
